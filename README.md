Kaggle Competition - Ashrae-energy-prediction dataset

It's no longer secret that the climate change is a major global concern and a significant challange. Being aware of this reality and in order to meet this challenge, significant investments are being made today to improve the efficiency of buildings in order to reduce not only greenhouse gas emissions but also the cost. However, there is always this question regarding the effectiveness of these efforts.
It was in this context that a competition was launched by Kaggle and which consisted of developping accurate models of metered building energy usage in the following areas: chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters. The data comes from over 1,000 buildings over a three-year timeframe. With better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.
We participated in this competition and the first thing we started with was an exploratory analysis so that we are more familiar with the data, which will allow us later to adopt the right strategies for managing missing values and feature engineering.
